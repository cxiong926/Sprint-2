			<p>I hope this is enough for the home page.  I think I'll eventually expand and use this for my portfolio site.  Thank you for visiting!  Please head over to my <a href="survey.html">student survey</a> if you aren't doing anything.</p>
				
			<h2>About me</h2>
				<img src="images/pic2.jpg" class="rounded float-right" title="Our Wedding Day">
				<p>I'm 28 years old and on my second attempt at college.  I was born and raised in Milwaukee and currently living in Wausau.  I'm enrolled in the Human Technology Interaction program and am due to graduate in Spring of 2020.</p>
				
				<p>My wife and I finally tied the knot earlier this month after a two year engagement.  It's been a fun journey so far and I'm sure it'll only get better as we get older.</p>
				
				<p>I really enjoy beer and travelling, especially together.  My all-time favorite beer is Lo-Gii from MKE Brewing Company.  It's been discontinued now, but I have one can left at home that I'm saving.  It's my most prized possession.  I really like going to new places and am trying to fill my passport as much as possible.  My favorite place ever is Japan.  I lived there for two years and loved every moment of it.  My ultimate goal is to retire there when I'm 30.  Fingers crossed!</p>

			
			<h2>Work</h2>
				<p>I'm currently looking for an internship in UX while going to school.  I'm finding it a little difficult since there aren't that many tech companies in the area.  My most recent job was as an Avionics Technician troubleshooting and repairing avionics equipment.  Before that I was a server at P.F. Changs.  Before that I was head grill boy at my local McDonalds.</p>
			
			<h2>Future Plans</h2>
				<p>My original plan for the future was to get a degree and go back to the military as an officer.  However, I've been really enjoying the HTI curriculum.  I think it's really interesting and the work stories from Professor Krause and Professor Weinschenk sound awesome! I think programming is fine, but I really enjoy the UX part of the major.  I'm on the fence with whether to pursue a career in UX or the military.  I've been leaning towards UX with the military as a fallback.</p>

				
			<h2>Contact</h2>
				<p>Feel free to talk to me in class or <a href="mailto:bxion419@uwsp.edu?subject=CNMT%20310">email</a> me if you ever have any questions.  Please refer to the <a href="privacy.html"> UW Privacy Policy</a> if for some reason you want to.</p>
